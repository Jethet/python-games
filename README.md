# python-games

After two years of learning Web Development with loads of JavaScript, React and Node.JS, this is my return to Python. I started coding by self-learning Python. When I got a grant for a bootcamp Web Development, I was introduced to JavaScript and could not believe how cumbersome JS is compared to Python. The teacher must have thought I was being a nuisance (although he never said anything), because in the first week of JS I kept remarking "if you code in Python this is soooo much easier and cleaner" and "why do I need so many lines of code for a simple if-else loop" .... ðŸ¤£

This is my first introduction to Pygame and I am amazed at how intuitive it is. My goal is to make use of some tutorials to learn about Pygame, and then try to design a game myself.

I coded my own version of Wordle - and it works! Too bad that it is so hard to make an interface because Python is not really for frontend. But maybe I'll find a way.
